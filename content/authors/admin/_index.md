My name is Muna Alhammadi and I have graduated from University of Sharjah, Biotechnology program with an M. Sc. degree. I enjoy visualizing biological data and implementing data science in biotechnology.

My undergraduate research was about using DNA barcoding to detect adulteration in different spices in the market. My M. Sc. thesis topic was about utilizing plants as biofactory to synthesize silver nanoparticles with antimicrobial and anticancer applications.

Besides biotechnology and data science, I also love landscape painting and drawing Islamic geometric patterns.
